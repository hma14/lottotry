            and <em>Potential Draws</em> to auto generate numbers with different combination. <br />
            These generated numbers are 
            not just simply random generated from 49 numbers (in case of 649) as they used to be done by lotto retailers.
            They are generated from a group of potential numbers which would filter out those "dead" numbers and selected
            from a complex processing via proprietary algorithms. You can generate numbers again and again until you satisfy. For the details how each of those 
            tools and statistics work, refer to <em>Docs</em> and <em>Video Clips</em> under <em>Guides</em> link found on menu bar.<br />

            numbers in order to sort out the best candidates for the next coming draw. Another appealing feature that LottoTry&trade; provides is that you can
            freely tune/calibrate variables that might affect the generated results significantly. Hence, users can enjoy the high degree of freedom in 
            generating random numbers on their own way, rather than laying their fate on hands of lotto retailers.<br />
            Always keep in mind that you are dealing with highly randomness in nature and the jackpot hit probability is 1:13,983,816 in case of 649.  
            Only tools like LottoTry&trade; can improve your chances in winning breakdown prices, even jackpot.
